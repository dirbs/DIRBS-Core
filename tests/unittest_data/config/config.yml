  # exempted_device_types contains a list of GSMA device types that do not require
  # registration in this country. Specifiying a list of device types here will mean
  # that the not_in_registration_list classification dimension will ignore IMEIs
  # whose TACs correspond to the listed device types. They will also be ignored in
  # the IMEI API's realtime registration check. The expected syntax for this is:

# Definitions of configuration variables related to pruning of subscriber data
# after a specified retention window
data_retention:
  # The number of months from the start of the current months that DIRBS core
  # will retain data about a triplet seen in its DB. After this time, the triplet
  # will be erased from the monthly_network_triplets tables (country and per-MNO).
  # The IMEI will continue to be stored after this date as it is needed for continued
  # list generation, etc. All references to IMSI and MSISDN will be pruned after this date.

# Definitions of configuration variables used by DIRBS Core in the list generation process.
list_generation:
  # The number of days that DIRBS core will look back through data from current date to determine IMSIs/MSISDNs
  # which were associated with the notifiable IMEIs.
  lookback_days: 180
  # If true, the exception list will contain only those IMEI-IMSI pairs where the IMEI is on the blacklist.

# Definitions of configuration variables used by DIRBS Core to determine how many workers to use to parallelise
multiprocessing:
  # The maximum number of local processing blade workers to use to achieve DIRBS Core tasks. This is particularly
  # useful for pre-validation of large operator import jobs where we can run multiple instances of the pre-validator
  # in parallel on different parts of the file. The default is to use half of the available CPUs in the
  # system will be used.
  # max_local_cpus: 10
  # The maximum number of database connections to use to parallelise DIRBS Core tasks. PostgreSQL 9.6 has support
  # for parellelising tasks internally - this setting does not affect parellelisation for a single connection.
  # Where PostgreSQL is unable to parallelise a single query by itself, we use this number of workers to issue
  # multiple queries at once on different connections. Generally this scales very well - it is safe to set this
  # reasonably high. It should probably be set to roughly the number of disks in your RAID array
